*Encoding Text to Morse Code*

The user enters text (alphabets or numbers) through the serial monitor or a user interface. The Arduino board processes the input and generates the corresponding Morse code output. The LED flashes to represent dots and dashes, and the buzzer produces auditory signals for dots and dashes.
*Decoding Morse Code to Text*

The user inputs Morse code by pressing the pushbutton for the appropriate durations representing dots and dashes. The Arduino board interprets the input and displays the decoded text on the serial monitor or a user interface.
